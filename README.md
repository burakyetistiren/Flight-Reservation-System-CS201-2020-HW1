Flight Reservation System

Implemented a flight reservation system for an imaginary airline company, which
operates multiple flights. Each flight has a unique flight number and is operated with an aircraft
that may have a different seating plan. According to its type, an aircraft has a specified number
of rows and number of seats in each row. (Although these numbers may change from one
aircraft type to another, the number of seats is the same for every row in the same aircraft.)
